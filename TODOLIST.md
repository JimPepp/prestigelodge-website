# To Do List

## Header - Menu

- Double clicking on the menu is breaking the alignment of the logo (DONE)
- Responsive design (DONE)
- Observer / ScrollTrigger.observe() on the menu image section.
- Second section does not load the image.

## Home Page
### Intro Section
- On the figma design there are images. This must be replaced with videos. 
- Consider the posibility to redesign the intro section with the videos occuping the full width of the screen.
- Observer / ScrollTrigger.observe() must be used to seamlessly transition between the videos and the text in each section.
