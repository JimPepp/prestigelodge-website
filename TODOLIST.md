# To Do List

## General
- Reconstruct the scrolled function from the header in a helpers file in order to call it from many components without having to duplicate it whenever we need it.

## Header - Menu
- The header logo animation currently runs pixel-based. Update it to animate based on justify-content. (DONE)
- Double clicking on the menu is breaking the alignment of the logo (DONE)
- Responsive design (DONE)
- Observer / ScrollTrigger.observe() on the menu image section. (DONE)
- Second section does not load the image. (DONE)
- Reconstruct the HTML in the image scroll. Get the text outside and set it to animate using the Text plugin.
- [BUG!] On window resize the header is being triggered (RESOLVED)

## Footer
- None currently.
- Finished

## Home Page
### Intro Section
- On the figma design there are images. This must be replaced with videos. (In progress)
- Consider the posibility to redesign the intro section with the videos occuping the full width of the screen.
- Observer / ScrollTrigger.observe() must be used to seamlessly transition between the videos and the text in each section.
